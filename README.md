Hello to the person sitting at the other end! ðŸ‘‹

I decided to create this project (website) not necessarily as an out-of-the-box idea, but rather to take this opportunity to hone our skills in web development and explore further possibilities.
This project serves as a learning experience while also being a functional and well-designed website.
This is my 1 Semester Project on Front-End Development.
